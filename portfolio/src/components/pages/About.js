        Full-stack web developer with much experience in management of time,
        staff, and budgets coming from a strong background in hospitality.
        Having spent 15 years in all areas of the industry and earning all
        qualifications necessary to do so, I have learned many transferable
        skills, from working under pressure in a kitchen and within strict time
        constraints, to strong people skills and risk management in the front of
        house. I am also currently completing a qualification in Training and
        Assessment which would allow me to teach any subject I am qualified in,
        including all the areas mentioned, along with any new skills I become
        certified.
